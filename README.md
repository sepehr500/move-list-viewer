## Getting started

I didn't feel comfortable adding the api key to the repo so there is a `secrets.sample.json`
file in `/src`. Create a file called `secrets.json` in that same folder and copy the contents of
the sample file into it. Then add your api key. `secrets.json` is git ignored.

run `npm start`
